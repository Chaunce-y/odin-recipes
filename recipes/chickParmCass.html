  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I came up with this easy casserole idea instead of making homemade Chicken Parmesan. Enjoy!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups rotini pasta</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) can chicken chunks, drained</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
      <li>Â½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rotini, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
      <li>Stir together the rotini, chicken, and mozzarella cheese in a large casserole dish. Pour the marinara sauce over the pasta mixture; sprinkle with bread crumbs. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is entirely melted, about 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
